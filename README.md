Binder can "turn a Git repo into a collection of interactive notebooks". Opening this repo up in Binder will allow you to run any of the `.ipynb` files in this repo as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). You can edit (but not save) and run the code in your browser. If you _really_ want to save the code, then you can click the download button in the notebook and then upload it to this repo. I reccomend clearing all of the output first (if you want). That way it will look "fresh" when opened.

This repo was created by following the instructions on [From Zero to Binder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder/workshop-presentations/zero-to-binder-python.md). 

This will work with the newer version of [Jupyter Labs](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jquintus/jupyter-binders/HEAD?urlpath=lab) as well.
